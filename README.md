# Multi-Agent Simulation For Collective Behavior

Group Social Force is implemented with Interactive Opinion Dynamics.  The fundamental idea is demonstrated as below. The model aims at investigating protypes of pedestrian behavior in a general sense. The current version of model especially contributes to simulating the crowd behavior in evacuation scenarios.

In the repository there are several small examples to test protypes of the model.  The example is written in Python, and Pygame is required to run the code.  
How-To: Run simulator_XXX.py in a python console

The source code runs well in Python 2.7.  The core computation runs OK in Python 3, but not sure about displaying the simulation result in Pygame with Python 3.    
Pull requests welcome!

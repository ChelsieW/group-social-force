# Pedestrian and Evacuation Dynamics

Pygame is required to run the code (Some scenarios also require matplotlib)

How-To: Run simulator_XXX.py in a python console

Cohesive social force model is simulated with interactive opinion dynamics

Effect of guidance (i.e., exit signs) is simulated for egress

Grouping behavior and initial evacuation delay are especially investigated
